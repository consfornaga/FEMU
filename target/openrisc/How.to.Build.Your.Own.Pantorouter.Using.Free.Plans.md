# How to Build Your Own Pantorouter Using Free Plans
 
A pantorouter is a woodworking machine that can cut mortise and tenon joints, dovetails, box joints, and other complex shapes using a router and a pantograph mechanism. A pantograph is a device that copies a pattern at a reduced or enlarged scale by tracing it with a stylus. A pantorouter uses a template to guide the stylus, which in turn moves the router along the same path as the template.

Building your own pantorouter can be a rewarding and fun project for woodworkers of all skill levels. You can save money by using materials you already have or can find easily, and you can customize your machine to suit your needs and preferences. Plus, you can enjoy the satisfaction of creating something useful and beautiful with your own hands.
 
Fortunately, there are free plans available online that you can download and follow to make your own pantorouter. In this article, we will show you how to find and use these plans to build your own pantorouter step by step.
 
## Step 1: Find and Download the Pantorouter Plans
 
The first step is to find and download the pantorouter plans that suit your router and your project goals. There are two main types of pantorouter plans: one for routers with cylindrical body up to 89 mm diameter and for palm routers, and one for plunge routers. The former is called the Pantorouter, and the latter is called the Pantorouter XL.
 
You can find both types of plans on the website of Matthias Wandel, a Canadian woodworker and engineer who invented the pantorouter. He sells his plans for $20 each, but he also offers them for free download as a zip file. You can access his website here: [https://woodgears.ca/pantorouter/plans/index.html](https://woodgears.ca/pantorouter/plans/index.html)
 
On his website, you can also see a preview of the plans, watch videos of him building and using the pantorouter, read testimonials from other users, and see photos of reader-built pantorouters. You can also buy a pre-built all metal pantorouter from his website if you prefer.
 
Once you have decided which type of plan you want, you can click on the download link and save the zip file to your computer. You will need a program that can open zip files, such as WinZip or 7-Zip. After you unzip the file, you will see several files inside, such as PDFs, JPGs, and SKPs.
 
## Step 2: Print and Review the Pantorouter Plans
 
The next step is to print and review the pantorouter plans. The plans include detailed drawings of every part of the pantorouter, full-scale printable templates of many parts, full-scale printable drawings of the assembled machine, detailed building instructions with over 200 photos (for the Pantorouter) or over 250 photos (for the Pantorouter XL), and a SketchUp model of the pantorouter.
 
You will need a printer that can print on A4 or letter size paper. You will also need Adobe Reader or another PDF viewer to open and print the PDF files. You can download Adobe Reader for free here: [https://get.adobe.com/reader/](https://get.adobe.com/reader/)
 
You should print all the PDF files at 100% scale (do not fit to page or shrink to fit). You should also check that your printer settings are correct by measuring the scale bars on each page. If they are not exactly 10 cm long, you may need to adjust your printer settings or use another printer.
 
You should also print out the JPG files that show the cutting diagrams for some parts. These will help you cut out the parts from plywood or other materials.
 
Finally, you should open and view the SketchUp model of the pantorouter using SketchUp, a free CAD program that you can download here: [https://www.sketchup.com/download](https://www.sketchup.com/download)
